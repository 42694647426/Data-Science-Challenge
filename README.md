Data Science Challenge solution

I share this repository using GitFront because It's not allowed to share a private repository via link on Github. The Jupyter Notebook is not rendered on GitFront, but I suppose you can download and open it to see the rendered notebook. Sorry for the inconveniences. 

**If the notebook has problem to be rendered, please email me anytime at hanyingshao@outlook.com ! I will make my repository public and share my github repository with you.**
